The first word of the latter has been correctly interpreted (if incorrectly read) by ASWI V as a “district” of Kalyan in which the nivesaṇaṃ was located, while the term <foreign>Abālikā-</foreign> has been interpreted as the name of the <foreign>vihāra</foreign> (and subsequently identified with the Ambivali caves 8km south-east from modern Kalyan). However, it is perhaps better to interpret it as the name of a “district” of Kalyan in which both the <foreign>vihāra</foreign> and this <foreign>nivesaṇa</foreign> were located. In KI 28 the nivesaṇa serves as the basis of an akṣayanīvī, with the accrued rent being distributed to provide provisions and repairs. It is likely that the nivesaṇa here serves a similar function (although it is not labeled as an akṣayanīvī) rather than being intended for use by the Saṃgha.

          <p n="6-7">Although difficult to fully understand, this sequence details the amount of interest that accrues from the invested funds. Given that interest is typically calculated monthly in ancient India, it is tempting to interpret vase vase as a mistake for <foreign>māse māse</foreign>, especially because of the vase immediately following the <foreign><unclear>hā</unclear></foreign>.
The use here of a reduplicated noun as a means of expressing indefiniteness may be compared with IBH III Maha 3.6 <foreign>kāraṇakāraṇe</foreign> “With regard to whichever reason/task” (cf. Martini 2023: 209) and KI 33.9 <foreign><unclear>pā</unclear>kkh<unclear>e</unclear> <unclear>p</unclear><supplied reason="lost">ā</supplied>kkh<unclear>e</unclear> <gap reason="illegible" quantity="2" unit="character"></gap> kāhhā<unclear>va</unclear>ṇ<unclear>a</unclear> kāhhāvaṇ<unclear>a</unclear> leṇe c<unclear>c</unclear>āv<unclear>i</unclear>tavva<unclear>ṁ</unclear></foreign> “whatever kahāpaṇas (accrue) every fortnight, the cave is to be maintained”.

CKM 1 78.c yaüdaeṇa). The final term is equivalent with the <foreign>paḍiAgitavaṁ</foreign> of KI 28.9 and 40.8, regarding which ASWI V (p. 81) states “<foreign>Paḍiagitava</foreign> is the fut. part. pass. of a denominative, derived from Sanskrit <foreign>pratyaṅga</foreign>, Pali <foreign>pachchaṅga</foreign>”. This is instead the gerundive of Pali paṭijaggati/BHS pratijāgarti “to watch over, nourish, take care of”. This may be compared with Visuddhimagga IV.5 <foreign>jiṇṇavihāre pana bahuṃ paṭijaggitabba</foreign> “in a dilapidated monastery there is much that needs repair”, cited by Silk (2008: 78) in his discussion on the term navakarmika.

The term <foreign>deyadhamaparicāka</foreign>is often associated exclusively with Northwestern India as it is found in inscriptions from Mathura (IV Math 17.2), Sanci (IV Sanc 907.3), and Gandhāra (CKI 60.5), with Damsteegt (1978: 163) stating that “the expression is foreign to inscriptions from other places”. However, the occurrence of the term here and in the 1st-2nd c. CE Alluru pillar inscriptions (EIAD 200+201) shows that this was not the case.
